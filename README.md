# Automative---Predictive-Maintenance-Model
In this project we are going to perform Random Forest Classifier for predicting need of maintenance for Automative Engines. 

Machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in automotive domain, from enhancing vehicle safety and efficiency to optimizing manufacturing processes.

Features of the dataset:

Engine rpm: Revolutions per minute of the engine.

Lub oil pressure: Pressure exerted by lubricating oil within the engine.

Fuel pressure: Pressure of the fuel supply to the engine.

Coolant pressure: Pressure of the engine coolant system.

Lub oil temp: Temperature of the lubricating oil.

Coolant temp: Temperature of the engine coolant.

Engine Condition: Indicates the health state of the engine (0 = unhealthy, 1 = healthy).

Random forest classifier

A Random Forest Classifier is a powerful machine learning algorithm widely used in various domains, including the automotive industry. It falls under the category of ensemble learning, which combines the predictions of multiple weaker models to create a single, more robust model. In the case of Random Forests, these weaker models are decision trees.
Basically

1.The algorithm first creates multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the training data with replacement.

2.At each node of a decision tree, the algorithm randomly selects a subset of features and chooses the best split based on a specific criterion to separate the data.

3.This introduces randomness and prevents any individual tree from over fitting the training data.

4.When presented with a new data point, each tree in the forest makes a classification prediction.

5.The final prediction is made by taking the majority vote of the individual tree predictions.


Key benefits of Random Forest Classifier:

1.High accuracy: Ensemble learning often leads to better performance compared to single models like decision trees.

2.Robust to overfitting: The introduction of randomness during training helps prevent the model from memorizing the training data and improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.

3.Handles both categorical and numerical features: This makes it versatile for various applications.

4.Provides feature importance: Random forests can indicate which features are most influential in making predictions, aiding in understanding the model's behavior.
